Rapid Application Development javascript (RAD.js) Toolkit
***
We reached the goal of creating a toolkit where each tool can be used separately for its specific tasks.
We upgrade [RAD.js](http://rad-js.com/ "rad-js.com") and split its functionality into independent modules, in order to make a good start for development of a toolkit (including frequently used UI widgets) for the most common tasks in mobile, web, and cross-platform development.
